  # The nginx container will act as a reverse proxy and should be the only
  # service exposed to the outside (notice the `ports` property). The `links`

      # This makes `samplesite` hostname reachable from this container.

    # This command takes our supplied config and runs it through envsubst to
    # replace all our environment variables, allowing us to use the variables
    # in our conf template. It also starts nginx in foreground mode.
    command: /bin/bash -c "envsubst < /etc/nginx/conf.d/docker/default.conf > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"

  # We are including the sample site in our local repo here, but the idea is
  # that every service pulls itself and its associated Dockerfile from its
  # respective git repository
  samplesite:
    build: ./sample-site
